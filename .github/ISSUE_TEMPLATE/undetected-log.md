**Log Entry**
Add your log entry here. Mark all the log lines that not detected with a `*`. Please surround it with a code block like this:

```
* Oxosk (1568612, Cloverfield) raises shields
```

You can cut out irrelevant lines from the log if you want to. Feel free to anonymize any coordinates, names and ids with fake ones but make sure the structure of the log stays intact!

**Language**
Which language is your log line in? I can probably tell from the log myself but it can't hurt to specify just in case.

**How to trigger the log**
Please describe how to trigger the log if you know, preferably in a list as follows:

1. Mess around aimlessly
2. ????
3. Profit!
